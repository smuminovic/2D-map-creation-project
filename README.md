## _2D environment map creation using PIC16F1939, serial communication module and stepper motor_

Area mapping system that uses an ultrasonic distance sensor, microcontroller PIC16F1939, serial communication module, step motor and PC. The sensor was attached to the motor and used to determine the distance between the sensor and objects around it. The distance value was then sent using the serial communication module to the PC. Graphical interface designed in MATLAB was used to receive the distance values, display and draw received values representing objectâ€™s location in a coordinate system. 

Tools:
- MATLAB
- MPLAB-X
- PICPgm
